# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is being able to see different versions of a file and using which versions of revisions you like. This is useful when there are many people working on a project. It allows them to merge their revisions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a a copy of a project that can be editted without changing the orginal project itself. You would use one if you wanted to work on a specific aspect of the project without messing up the rest of it.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in your git. A good commit message will be concise on what was updated in the last modification.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you merge 2 branches that have changed the same aspect of the project differently to the master branch. Git will not know which one to use.
